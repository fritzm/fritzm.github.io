        <div><p>Some friends of mine own vintage arcade games.  Two of them had Atari Tempest machines (one a full-size
upright, one the rather more rare "cabaret") that had ceased to play, so I offered to look at them both if
they could be dropped off here at my home. Some time later, and here they are in the garage (the Space Duel
upright in the background is my own):</p>

<img src='/images/arcades/tempest-bench_thumbnail_tall.png' title='Atari Tempest running on the bench' onclick='pswipe("arcades",2);'/></p>
<p>Overall, these are not too complicated, and pretty easy to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a straightforward linear supply in the bottom of the cabinet, known as the "brick", which
  provides +10.6 VDC and 50, 36, and 6 VAC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A separate card, the "AR2" (downstream of the brick, also linear), derives +12, +/-5, and +/-22 VDC, as
  well as hosting audio power amplifiers for game sound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "brains" of the game are a control board with a 1.5 MHz 6502A processor, ROMs, RAM, and GPIO for
  settings DIP switches, coin door etc. Since Tempest is a vector game, a fair bit of the control board is
  also dedicated to vector generation; Tempest uses an "analog vector generator" where vectors are swept by
  analog integrators with rate inputs fed by DACs.  The control board has a daughter-card which has 4x AMD2901
  bit-slice ALUs to assist the 6502 with math, and a couple of custom Atari chips ("POKEYs") for sound sound
  generation and game control input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last, there is a color vector CRT, the WG6100.  This has X and Y deflection amplifiers similar to an
  oscilloscope, and accepts RGB inputs for color/intensity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These games are quite common, so all of these components have well-understood failure modes; you will find
these discussed in various arcade repair online forums and FAQs.  The stuff I always look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Brick: There is a large electrolytic, known as "big blue", which is the primary filter for the +10.6 VDC.
  If it is still the '80s original, it is probably worth a check.  Modern drop-in replacements are available
  for ~$15 USD.</p>
<p>There is also a fuse block wired in with crimp quick-disconnects. They are problematic because they may
oxidize or rattle loose, causing increased resistance and eventually thermal runaway as the currents here
are in the multi-amp range and the brick is located at the bottom of the cabinet where air circulation is
not great. It is not uncommon to find toasty wiring and/or melted plastic fuse blocks; if doing repairs in
this area I'll generally just clip off the quick disconnect connectors entirely and solder the wires down
directly to the fuse block tabs to avoid future reliability issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AR2: Common fails here are also generally thermal issues. Recap kits for these boards are available from the
  arcade parts houses, but in my experience aren't often required. Each of the supplies on the AR2 is pretty
  easy to bench test, but make sure you test with at least a minimal load in place as some of the linear
  regulators here will behave unpredictably when unloaded.  I've never personally seen a failure of the
  integrated audio amplifiers on the AR2, so I generally don't bother to test them up front; if I have an
  audio problem with the game I will come back and give them a look later.</p>
<p>The +5 VDC supply here works with a remote sense, which is a matter of some controversy.  There can be an
appreciable (and variable between cabinets) voltage drop from the AR2 to the game boards over the molex
connectors, wiring harness, and game board edge connectors in between.  Atari seems to have gone for a
remote sense design to automatically compensate for this.  The problem is that it is not uncommon for the
board edge connectors to loosen over time and/or accumulate dust and oxidation, increasing resistance, and
leading to another thermal runaway situation as the supply keeps upping the juice to overcome
ever-increasing resistive drop.  It is not uncommon to see toasted wiring, toasted AR2, and/or even burnt
board traces.</p>
<p>Some techs advocate short circuiting the remote sense at the AR2 (known as the "sense mod") with the
argument that it is less destructive to fail into a game-board-under-voltage condition than to fail into
an over-current-until-something-burns situation.  Others insist the original design is fine as long as
board and harness connections are well maintained.  I tend to leave things stock unless there is evidence
of a problem. If a particular cabinet looks like a chronic +5 burner, though, I'll go ahead and implement
the sense mod as well as repairing/replacing the board edge connector; I also add some additional beefy supply and ground wires directly between the AR2 and voltage test terminals on the game boards to shed
load off the board edge connector.</p>
<p>For a toasted +5 supply, check Q3, the TO3 series pass transistor on the large heat sink.  Sometimes this
fails just because of poor thermal connectivity with the heat sink; replacing the stock mica insulator
with a silpad and a very thin coat of fresh thermal grease can help here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WG6100 color vector display: This is its own odyssey :-)  Lot's of good info on trouble-shooting and
  repairing these is available on the web. In particular, there is a low-voltage supply section on the
  deflection board which is quite failure-prone.  There are drop-in replacement supply circuits available; you
  pull all the components in the original section and solder in a small pre-fab daughter board in their place
  (google "LV-2000").  This upgrade increases the long-term reliability of the WG6100 to such a significant
  extent that I always opt to install one of these if not already present.</p>
<p>Next most common are fails with the through-hole cable pin connectors.  Solder connections here break from
repeated mechanical stresses of plugging and unplugging connecting cables, and for some reason the
original factory solders here seem pretty shoddy.  Always worth giving these a reflow with some fresh
solder.</p>
<p>TO3 deflection transistors are mounted off board on the monitor chassis, using the chassis as one big heat
sink.  These are frequently a casualty of some other cascading failure in the monitor.  Flying leads to
the sockets holding these transistors sometimes break loose from mechanical stresses, or the old sockets
may fail, or mica insulators may develop shorts to the chassis (silpad etc. treatment is generally a good
idea here too.)</p>
<p>One thing to be careful of here is that there seem to be a lot of counterfeits of these particular
transistors (2N3716/2N3792) on the market.  Counterfeits will <em>mostly</em> work, but can exhibit some strange
instabilities at cross-over which can manifest as ringing and parasitics in the deflection amplifiers
causing "wiggly" vectors that can be difficult to troubleshoot (see pictures from another WG6100 monitor
repair immediately below).  Make sure to order from one of the larger, more reliable, parts houses for
these.</p>
<p><img src='/images/arcades/wg6100-deflection-parasitic_thumbnail_tall.jpeg' title='A parasitic oscillation from a conterfeit deflection transistor in a WG6100 vector monitor.  Stimulus is a 1 KHz 8V p-p sine wave.  Parasitic initiates near cross-over.' onclick='pswipe("arcades",3);'/>
<img src='/images/arcades/wg6100-deflection-parasitic-zoomed_thumbnail_tall.jpeg' title='Zoom in on parasitic oscillation in WG6100 deflection amplifier.  Parasitic is approx 4 MHz 200 mV.' onclick='pswipe("arcades",4);'/></p>
<p>The HV supply in these monitors seems particularly hard on its electrolytic caps; I've seen more cap
failures in these HV supplies than anywhere else in these games.  Generally worth just doing a recap kit
on the HV board if the caps don't look fresh when you get there; it can help improve the stability and
appearance of the monitor a lot.  After achieving correct and stable B+ on the HV supply, if there still
seem to be brightness problems, check C503 on the neck board and refresh if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Game boards: there are eight small PCB mount potentiometers for trimming the analog X/Y outputs.  The stock
  parts are open-frame and seem to collect dust and get twitchy and intermittent (open wiper contacts here can
  be a cause of loss of video output).  I generally just go ahead and freshen these before starting in on the
  boards, as I hate working with them when they are intermittent/unreliable.</p>
<p>Solder fails in the large interconnect between the mother and daughter boards are also common; these are
also worth a preemptive reflow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These two games from my friends were no exception to the above, and after working the standard stuff for both
I had two working bricks, two working AR2s, two working monitors, and one working board set.  The second board
was producing no output of any sort, didn't appear to respond to its reset switch, and required further
investigation.</p>
<p>Okay, like any microprocessor project, start with power, clock and reset...  Power looked fine.  Clock, not
so much.  Here's the clock circuit:</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" src="/images/arcades/tempest-clock.png" 
title="Atari Tempest clock circuit"/></p>
<p>12 MHz crystal with some pulse shaping scoped out fine.  Master clock then goes to counter chip C4 to divide
down to various derived clocks, including the crucial PHI0 for the 6502.  Turns out this counter wasn't
counting because its clear input (pin 14, seen arriving from below) was being continuously driven.  That input
comes from the watchdog circuit and power on reset circuit:</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" src="/images/arcades/tempest-watchdog.png" 
title="Atari Tempest watchdog circuit"/></p>
<p>Reset was continuously asserted here because of a dodgy Molex connector which was not delivering +10.6 VDC to
TL082 K11 at the left.  After fixing this, the machine came out of reset, the reset button was working, and
there were signs of activity on the 6502 data and address busses.  But the game wasn't really running, and the
watchdog was repeatedly timing out, so it seemed to be executing incorrect code.</p>
<p>Pulled the game ROMs, and used a burner/reader to verify their checksums against published values from the
arcade game forums (all good).  Checked for shorts around the sockets (found none) and reseated the ROMs.
Pulled the 6502 and manually drove address bus lines to verify proper operation of the ROM address decoders
(all fine). Okay, so time to watch the microprocessor busses on a logic analyzer and see what's going on...</p>
<p>Now, I love my old HP 1660 logic analyzer, lots, but a friend had recently loaned to me a compact 34-channel
USB logic analyzer (Intronix LA1034) to see if I might be interested in buying it, and I decided to give it a
try for this project.  It was pretty easy to probe up the 6502 with a DIP clip, and the software for the
analyzer (Windows only) installed and ran without difficulty on my Windows 10 VM.</p>
<p>When the 6502 comes out of reset, it fetches its reset vector from locations FFFC and FFFD, then jumps to
that address.  Looking at the Tempest ROM listings, the reset vector is supposed to point to address D93F.
Watching the 6502 address and data busses, and setting a trigger for address FFFC, we can immediately see
a problem:</p>
<p><br><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"
src="/images/arcades/tempest-reset-bad.png" title="Atari Tempest 6502 coming out of reset w/ bad data
fetch"/><br></p>
<p>Here, the top line is the 6502 address bus, and the middle line is the 6502 data bus.  The bottom line is the
output on the ROM bus, upstream of the driver which gates it onto the data bus.</p>
<p>The 6502 comes out of reset, and attempts reads of locations FFFC and FFFD, as visible on the address bus, but
it is receiving incorrect data (C82E vs. the expected D93F).  It then jumps to the incorrect address, and from
that point onward we are off in the weeds.  Interestingly, we can see here that the ROM is, in fact,
presenting the correct data.</p>
<p>So the first thing was to try replacing the bus driver between the ROM and the 6502 data busses, but this did
not fix the issue (sadness).  Besides this and the 6502 itself (already verified by swap with the other
working game board) there are only two other drivers on the processor data bus: H2, leading to the daughter
board, and F2 leading to the RAM bus.  ROM bus seen entering here from the bottom:</p>
<p><br><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" src="/images/arcades/tempest-data-bus.png"
title="Atari Tempest microprocessor data bus"/><br></p>
<p>One of these two drivers must be dragging down a couple of lines on the data bus; nothing to do here but try swapping them out one by one.  Tried F2 first, and got lucky!  Game code began to run, and the game board produced vector outputs.  Correct reset sequence after the fix:</p>
<p><br><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"
src="/images/arcades/tempest-reset-good.png" title="Atari Tempest 6502 coming out of reset w/ correct sequencing"/><br></p>
<p>From this point forward, just wrap-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The X positions on the ends of some vectors on the second game board set looked slightly incorrect, beyond
  what could be adjusted with via the associated rate op-amp offset ("BIP", in Atari-speak) trimmer.  This
  usually indicates a failing rate DAC. Replaced the X rate DAC on this board and the problem was addressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various small mechanical repairs to the cabinets, replacement of bits of missing hardware, and cleanup of a
  hacked-up wiring harness on one of the machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cabaret machine had a failed fluorescent tube fixture for its marquee light; after checking with the
  owner, pulled this and replaced with an LED fixture for greater reliability (I like <a href="https://hamiltonbowes.com/collections/l3-series-120v-led-lighting-system/products/12-strip-light-white-plastic">this one</a>,
  which is a 120v fixture that doesn't need a separate transformer or supply.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another upgrade I really like for Tempest machines is a set of brass bushings for the spinner (available
  <a href="https://www.arcadefixit.com/product.sc?productId=382">here</a>).  These make the spinner quiet and smooth as
  butter.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All done now, and ready to be returned to their owners (after some extensive "burn in" play testing, of
course! :-)</p></div>
