        <div><p><em>[A catch-up article, documenting discoveries of Jan/Feb 2019]</em></p>
<p>In early 2019, I made a V6 Unix pack from the Ken Wellsch tape image, as mentioned in <a href="https://fritzm.github.io/unix-and-ms11.html">this blog
entry</a>.  It booted on my machine, but dumped core on the first <code>ls</code> in single-user
mode, or as soon as I did any heavy lifting in multi-user mode.</p>
<p>The following is the first part of a chronology of the troubleshooting campaign that took place over the next
month and a half, culminating in a smoking gun hardware fix and successful operation of V6 Unix on the
machine.  This was largely a collaborative effort between Noel Chiappa an myself via direct email
correspondence, though help was received from others via the cctalk mailing list as well.</p>
<h3>January 8-9</h3>
<p>Initial experiments.  Described the <code>ls</code> crashes to Noel.  He theorizes that <code>ls</code> works in one case and
crashes in another is because it lands in a different spot in memory in each case.</p>
<p>Luckily, a subsequent <code>od</code> on the core file does not crash, and a core file is successfully extracted:</p>

<p>Noel prepares to analyze the core file (block quotes here and further below taken from email correspondence):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just checked, and the binary for the 'ls' command is what's called 'pure code'; i.e. the instructions are
in a separate (potentially shared) block of memory from the process' data (un-shared).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>On another front, that error message ("Memory error") is produced when a process gets a 'memory management
trap' (trap to 0250). This could be caused by any number of things (it's a pity we don't know the contents
of SR0 when the trap happened, that would tell us exactly what the cause was).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>[Memory management registers in the core dump] are 'prototypes', later modified for actual use by adding in
the actual address in main memory. Still trying to understand how that works - the code (in sureg() in
main.c) is kind of obscure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>January 10-24</h3>
<p>Further communication with Noel and the cctalk list raises some suspicion about the memory in my machine.
Though I had done spot checks and repairs on this in the past, which had been sufficient to pass most MAINDEC
diagnostics and to boot and run RT11, in fact the memory had not yet been exhaustively tested.</p>
<p>Over the course of some days, memory test codes are developed and run, and several additional failed DRAMs in
the MS11 memory system are isolated and repaired.  These efforts have previously been reported in detail in
<a href="https://fritzm.github.io/unix-and-ms11.html">this blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>After these repairs, the MAINDEC MS11 memory diagnostics and KT11-C MMU diagnostics, both of which are beastly
and exhaustive, are found to pass robustly with one caveat: memory parity tests.  A deep-dive into the design
and implementation of memory parity on the PDP-11/45 follows.  At the end it is concluded that the machine, a
very early serial no. in its line, is in fact functioning per-design. These efforts are documented in <a href="https://fritzm.github.io/parity-handling.html">this
blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>Even though the memory system looks solid after this, the V6 Unix crash behavior remains exactly the same...</p>
<h3>January 27-29</h3>
<p>With the KT11 and memory now verified, Noel takes up the core dump again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is that Unix does not save enough info in the core dump for me to thoroughly diagnose the MM
fault; e.g. 'ls' is a 'pure text' program/command, and the code's not included in the core dump (in normal
operation, there's no need/use for it), so I don't have the code that was running at the time, just the data
and swappable per-process kernel data - which is not all the per-process data, e.g. it doesn't include the
location of the process's code and data segments in main memory.</p>
<p>Also, I'll look at the V6 code that sets up the KT11 registers to make sure I understand what it's doing.
(The dump contains the 'prototype' for those contents, but the values are modified, by adding the actual
memory location, before being stored in the KT11.)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>I did find out that the PC at the time of the segmentation fault was 010210, which I thought looked awfully
big (so I was wondering if somehow it went crazy), but in fact the text size is 010400, so it's just inside
the pure text.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We agree to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions%27_Commentary_on_UNIX_6th_Edition,_with_Source_Code"><em>Lions</em></a> as a common
reference point for detailed discussion of the loading and running of "ls" and what may be seen in the core
dump.</p>
<h3>January 30</h3>
<p>Noel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, a bit more from my examination of the swappable per-process kernel data (the 'user' structure - not sure
how much of a Unix internals person you are).</p>
<p>It gives the following for the text, data and stack sizes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>tsize 000104
dsize 000035
ssize 000024
</pre></div>


<p>which seems reasonable/correct, because looking at the header for 'ls' we see:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>000410 010400 001050 002366 000000 000000 000000 000001
</pre></div>


<p>'0410' says it's pure text, non-split; the 010400 is the text size, which matches (those sizes above are in
'clicks', i.e. the 0100 byte quantum used in the PDP-11 memory management).</p>
<p>The data size also appears to be correct:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>001050 (initialized)
002366 (BSS)
------
003436
</pre></div>


<p>which again matches (round up and divide by 0100).</p>
<p>I have yet to dig around through the system sources and see what the initial stack allocation is, to see if
that's reasonable (of course, it may have been extended during execution).</p>
<p>And here are the 'prototype' segmentation register contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>UISA 000000 000020 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 177701
UDSA 000000 000020 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 177701
UISD 041402 016006 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 066016
UDSD 041402 016006 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 066016
</pre></div>


<p>Since it's not split, the D-space ones are clones of the I-space (which is what the code does - I don't
think it turns user D off and on, depending on what the process has: I'd have made context switching faster
by not having to set up the D-space registers for non-split processes, but I guess the extra overhead is
pretty minimal).</p>
<p>I have yet to check all the contents to make sure they look good, but the U?SA registers look OK; the '020'
is for the data, and that's kept contiguous with the 'user' area, so the '020' is to offset past that.</p>
<p>The PC at fault time of 010210 seems to point to the following code (assuming what was in main memory was
actually the same as the binary on the disk):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>        mov r4,r0
        jmp 10226
210:    mov r5,r0 
        mov sp,r5
</pre></div>


<p>We don't have SSR2, which points to the failing instruction, and I forget whether the saved PC on an MMU
fault points to the failing instruction, or the next one; I'm going to assume the latter.</p>
<p>But either way, this is very puzzling, because I don't see an instruction there that could have gotten an
MMU fault! The jump is to a location within the text segment (albeit at the end), and everything else it
just register-register moves!</p>
<p>And how could the fault depend on the location in main memory?!?!</p>
<p>If you want to poke around in the core dump yourself, to verify that I haven't made a mistake, see this
page:</p>
<p><a href="http://gunkies.org/wiki/Unix_V6_dump_analysis">http://gunkies.org/wiki/Unix_V6_dump_analysis</a></p>
<p>which gives useful offsets. (The ones in the user table I verified by writing a short program which did
things like 'printf("%o", &amp;0-&gt;u_uisa)', and the data at those locations looks like what should be there, so
I'm pretty sure that table is good. For the other one, core(5) (in the V6 man pages) gives the register
offsets (albeit in a different form), so you can check that I worked them out correctly.</p>
<p>Two things you could try to get rid of potential pattern sensitivities: before doing the 'ls', say 'sleep
360 &amp;' first; that running in the background <em>should</em> cause the 'ls' to be loaded and run from a different
address in main memory. The other thing you could try is 'cp /bin/ls xls' and then 'xls', to load the
command from a different disk location. (Both of these assume that you don't get another fault, of course!)</p>

<p>[Initial stack size] is 20. clicks, which is what it still is (024 clicks) in the process core dump, so
the stack has <em>not</em> been extended. So any MM fault you see after starting 'ls' will <em>probably</em> be the one
that's causing the process to blow out.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried to re-create that exact version of the 'ls' binary, because the one in the distro is stripped, and I
wanted one with symbols to look at. I failed, because a library routine (for dates) has changed on my
machine, see here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chiappa.net/~jnc/tech/V6Unix.html#Issues">http://www.chiappa.net/~jnc/tech/V6Unix.html#Issues</a></p>
<p>However, I did verify that the binary for ls.o is identical to what I can produce (using the -O flag). It's
just that library routine which is different. I don't think it's worth backing out my library; I did manage
to hand-produce a stub of the symbol table for where the error is happening in the old 'ls' binary:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>010210T csv
010226T cret
010244T cerror
010262T _ldiv
010304T _lrem
010324T _dpadd
</pre></div>


<p>The fault does indeed seem to be happening at either the last instruction in the previous routine (ct_year,
in ctime.c), or the first of csv.</p>
<p>(I should explain that PDP-11 C uses two small chunks of code, CSV and CRET, to construct and take down
stack frames on procedure entry and exit. So on exit from <em>any</em> C procedure, the last instruction is always
an PC-relative jump to CRET.)</p>
<p>It looks like that's what's blowing up - but it apparently works with the command at a different location in
main memory! So it pretty much has to be a pattern sensitivity.</p>
<p>However, I think the KT11 does the bounds checking <em>before</em> it does the relocation - the bounds checking is
done on virtual, un-relocated addresses. So <em>that</em> part of it <em>should</em> be the same for both locations! So
here's my analysis:</p>
<p>Is it actually an indexed jump that's blowing up? I've been looking at the command binary, but that might
not be what's in main memory. Or the CPU might be looking somewhere else (because of a KT error). (If we
don't find the problem soon, we might want to put in that breakpoint so we can look in main memory and see
what inst is actually at the location where SSR2 says the failing inst was; that can rule out a whole bunch
of potential causes in one go - e.g. RK11 errors.)</p>
<p>If it is actually that jump that's failing - how? The PC hasn't been updated yet, so it can't be the fetch
of the next instruction that's failing. Is the fetch of the index word producing the MM fault?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fritz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It occurs to me that we don't even <em>really</em> know if the fault occurs from the same address every time, since
we have a core sample size of 1; I should duplicate the fail and extract another core file to compare.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Another thing I thought I might try tonight: deposit a trap catcher in the memory mgmt trap location from
the front panel, just before issuing the 'ls' command.  I can then check the PSW, PC, SP, and KT11 regs
right at the time of fault.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that's a really important data-point. The fact that it is physical location dependent really does tend
to implicate the KT11; I think the KB11 mostly only knows/has virtual addresses? (So I probably shouldn't
bang my head trying to think of failure modes in the KB11?) If you have the source for its diag, you might
try looking through it, looking for things it doesn't try...</p>
<p>Although I suppose it could be a location-dependent issue with the RK11. I should explain how to find, and
examine the pure-text for the 'ls' command; if you halt the CPU on the trap again, look at UISA0, and that
should give you the 'click' where the text starts; at that point I'd probably examine every 256th (block
size) word and we can compare them to the original to make sure the in-core copy is OK.</p>

<p>If it's really 010210, I wonder how it could be a fault on page 1; each page (segment, really) of virtual
address space is 020000 long, so that address is well inside page 0?</p>
<p>Unless it has fetched some other instruction, due to some other error, one which does try and do something
on page 1... Might want to try looking at a few instructions around 010210 when you try this again, see
what's actually there. Let's see, code starts at 0161400 in real memory (per UIPAR0 below), so 010210 is at
0171610... Maybe dump a few words from 171600 on?</p>

<p>No; you're running binary for a /40 system, so no split I/D. So also, all the UDPARs and UDPDRs will contain

<p>?? UIPAR7 looks wrong; if the data is really at 01760, I think the stack should be above that in real memory
- but I might be wrong, I will check.</p>
<p>If it is wrong, did something cause the wrong value to be stored there (e.g. an error in the execution of
lines 1750/1751 in Lions); or was the prototype calculated wrong (around line 1704) - but I think the
prototypes looked correct in the process' core dump, but I will check them; or did the hardware flake out,
and e.g. copy a later store (the code fills them from the top down) up to UISA7?</p>
<p>To check out the latter, maybe a bespoke tiny program, toggled in, to try storing the 'correct' data in the
UISPARs, in the exact way that the Unix code does it, and then look and see what's in there?</p>
<p>This might also correlate to the strange stuff I saw in the process' user-mode stack, in the dump - I will
go back and look at that now.</p>
<p>If you do this again, please add KISA6 and KISD6 to the registers to dump (you can skip UDS*), so we can see
what it thinks is going on with the per-process swappable data, which should be just below the process'
user-mode data, in terms of real memory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the stack is directly above the user data, which is directly above the swappable per-process data (user
struct, and kernel stack). But the address math for stack segments in the KT11 is weird (see below).</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> the prototypes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>UISA 000000 000020 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 177701
UISD 041402 016006 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 066016
</pre></div>


<p>are right, but the negative direction of the stack is making my head hurt (and the UISA7 you recorded from
the hardware might be right after all - but then the UISA0 might be wrong - it's suspicious, but not
impossible, that they are the same value).</p>
<p>If the SPPD is at physical xxx, the user data will be at xxx+20 (in clicks, as above) through xxx+20+34
(below), and then the stack above that. Per the SPPD:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>tsize 000104
dsize 000035
ssize 000024
</pre></div>


<p>the stack should then run from xxx+20+35 to xxx+20+35+23. The way the MM hardware works for stack segment,
the 'base' is where the first click would be if the segment were a full 0200 clicks. (Per the example in the
/45 proc handbook; for a 3-click stack running from physical 0331500 to 0331776, the PAR would contain
03120, i.e. segment base at 0312000.)</p>
<p>So let me do the math (please check to see if I'm confused :-); base of user data is at 0176000 (per UISA1
contents), runs to 0201476 (i.e. plus 03500); the stack would run from 0201500 to 0204076 (i.e. plus 02400).
So the stack segment 'base' would be 020000 below the next word, or 0164100.</p>
<p>(My head hurts too much to work out if the 177701 of the prototype is right; basically, the location of the
SPPD in clicks would be 01740 (I <em>think</em> - 01760 - 020), and that plus 177701 should give us 01641.)</p>
<p>But, anyway, I'm fairly sure that 01614 is <em>not</em> right for UISA7 (unless it really was 1641 and you inverted
the digits because it looked so close).</p>
<p>Having KISA6 would help since it would give us a cross-check on the value of UISA1.....</p>

<p>So, according to the process core dump, these are the register contents at the time of the fault:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>R0 177770
R1 0
R2 0
R3 0
R4 34
R5 444
SP 177760
PC 010210
PS 170010
</pre></div>


<p>Now, PDP-11 uses R5 for a frame pointer, set up thus:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>        jsr     r5,csv        (first instruction in every C routine)

csv:
        mov     r5,r0
        mov     sp,r5
        mov     r4,-(sp)
        mov     r3,-(sp)
        mov     r2,-(sp)
        tst     -(sp)
        jmp     (r0)
</pre></div>


<p>on subroutine entry (the 'jsr r5, csv' pushes the old R5 contents, and temporarily saves the return PC - to
just after the call to CSV, not to the sunroutine which called this one, that's further down - in R5). So,
except for the first two instructions of CSV, R5 <em>always</em> contains an old SP.</p>
<p>Now look at the R5 from the crash. That's not an old SP. Something has already gone seriously wrong by this
point - actually, likely the process has just started to run the newly-loaded command code (see below), and
hasn't even set up its first stack frame yet.</p>
<p>Now look at the top of the stack, as recorded in the process' core dump:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">0010060</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">000000</span> <span class="mi">000020</span> <span class="mi">000001</span> <span class="mi">177770</span> <span class="mi">177774</span> <span class="mi">177777</span> <span class="mi">071554</span> <span class="mi">000000</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And that's <em>it</em>; the rest if all 0's! (The base address does seem to correspond; with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dsize 000035
ssize 000024
</pre></div>


<p>and the SPPD being 020 clicks, that puts the top of the stack at 0101 clicks, or 010100, and the last
location there is 010076.</p>
<p>The core dump routine, core() writes the user data out in two transfers (Lions 4113-4124), one for the SPPD,
one for the user's data+stack. So we probably got the SPPD OK, but the rest - who knows?</p>
<p>It does call estabur(), which sets up the prototype MM register contents, and then writes them into the
actual registers, so the prototypes in the process' core dump that I was looking at before have already been
overwritten. :-(But estabur() then called sureg (Lions 1724) so hopefully the MM regs wound up pointing to
the actual memory being used for the stack - but who knows?</p>
<p>Anyway, looking at the contents, the top of the stack does look vaguely like what it should be when the
command <em>starts</em> executing, after the exec() call; the SP is even reasonable; it points to that 0 at offset
010060.</p>
<p>The 020 is the return point for the call to _main (see below; that 'jsr pc,_main' ends at 016); the '1' is
probably 'nargs' (see Exec(II) in the V6 Manual), the '0177770' is argv, '177774' is argv[0], 177777 is
argv[1] (end of list marker), and '071554' is 'ls' (the command name, by convention the first argument).</p>
<p>R0 contains what looks like an old SP, although I suppose that could have been
left over from the assembler startup:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">start</span><span class="o">:</span>
          <span class="n">setd</span>
          <span class="n">mov</span>     <span class="n">sp</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">r0</span>

          <span class="n">jsr</span>     <span class="n">pc</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">_main</span>
</pre></div>


<p>but clearly the attempt to execute the first instruction in CSV blew up. And where did the '444' in R5 come
from? The call to CSV is at 030?</p>

<p>Those all look OK: KISD6 show the segment length as 020 (017 being the last valid click), which is right,

<p>So maybe the RK11 went berserk? But maybe not...</p>
<p>The 4767 is a 'jsr pc, xxx' which is typical C compiler emission, but the rest looks like rubbish - 6700 is
a SXT R0, for instance.</p>
<p>What's actually there at 010210 (virtual) still doesn't explain the MM trap we got; 'SXT R0' should have
executed OK, no matter what? Confoozled...</p>

<p>executed OK, and then it tried to go off to csv, only there's trash there? And what's with the 0444 in R5?
That should be 034, the return from that last JSR.</p>
<p>I'm going to go ponder all this. One more thing you could try is do this all again, and write down the first
couple of instructions at the start of the text segment (UISA0 = 01614, so 0161400 on for a few words), so
we can see if <em>that</em> looks OK.</p>
<p>If so, it will look like the command got read in off the disk wrong - since it's not coming from swap (it's
just starting), it's coming out of the file system wrong. Why will be a good question.</p>
<p>And I still don't understand the 'segment 1' fault, and the R5 contents - so many things going wrong all at
once, for reasons that make no sense... I wonder if there's a noise glitch hitting several things all at the
same time?</p>

Suggestions start to flow in.  Some have already been tried or can be ruled out.  Some others:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bob Smith: "I keep wondering about the psu...".  This gets some agreement from the list, and a few
  interesting/relevant anecdotes are relayed.  Paul Koning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In RSTS development we once ran into DMC-11s not working reliably.  The field service tech knew exactly
what to look for, and started checking all the supply voltages.  The spec says allowed tolerances are
+/- 5%.  He knew the reality for correct operation was -0%, +5%, so he tweaked all the supplies to read
a hair above nominal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warner Losh:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recall our PDP-11 tech tweaking +5V from 5.05V to 4.95V and back again to demonstrate that tiny
differences matter a lot on one of the cranky 11/23+''s we had after I made a particularly unhelpful
teenage smart ass remark... The 11/23+ wouldn't boot at the slightly lower than full voltage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worth noting that in both of these cases, a slight undervoltage proved problematic...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paul Koning suggests a potential KT11 failure mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another possibility occurs to me: bad bits in the MMU (UISAR0 register if I remember correctly).  Bad
memory is likely to show up with a few bits wrong; if UISAR0 has a stuck bit so the "plain" case maps
incorrectly you'd expect to come up with execution that looks nothing at all like what was intended.</p>

<p>Mattis Lind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would it be any difference if you run the machine at full speed or lower speed or even single step past
this instruction? ... The TIG module has a separate non crystal controlled oscillator which one could
tune for marginal checking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, yes, the margining clock!  Always worth a check, and very easy to use with if you have a KM11 handy.
A variety of clock speeds are tried, but the behavior remains the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brent Hilpert:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For consideration, what about the refresh circuitry of the memory board?</p>
<p>Mem diagnostics, unless they explicitly account for it, may not show up problems with memory refresh if
the loop times are short enough to effectively substitute as refresh cycles, while they could show up
later in real-world use with arbitrary time between accesses.</p>
<p>Refresh on some early boards/systems was asynchronously timed by monostables or onboard oscillators
which can drift or fail on the margin/slope. (I don't know what DEC's design policy was for DRAM
refresh). It might also explain why a number of 4116s were (apparently) failing earlier in the efforts
(if I recall the discussion correctly), replacing them might have just replaced them with 'slightly
better' chips, i.e. with a slightly longer refresh tolerance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one also gets some follow-up.  The schematics are consulted, and the MS11-L refresh is seen, indeed,
to be driven by a simple free-running 555.  Further from Brent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4116 datasheet specs 2mS, my calcs give a refresh period of 1.5mS, the 14.5uS from the manual would give
1.86 mS, 7% shy of 2. The schematic specs 1% resistors, and the parts list does appear to spec a
high-tolerance "1%200PPM" cap.</p>
<p>Although there are the internal voltage divider Rs in the 555 which are also critical for the timing and
everything is 40+ years old...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The actual MS11 in use measures out on my 'scope at 15.2us.  From Brent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>15.2uS gives a 1.95mS refresh, so it's awfully close to the 2mS spec, but still within.  The datasheet I
was looking at doesn't seem to give any spec for tolerance on the refresh so one would guess there's a
safety margin built into the 2mS spec.</p>

<p>Okay, I've had a bit of time in front of the machine to repro this and take a look.  What I actually see is:</p>

<p>(remember, for the last, this will have been after taking a trap to 250, where I have the usual "BR .+2;
HALT" catcher installed)</p>
<p>Also, memory at 060 (PA:164060) is all zeros as far as the eye can see...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, a big discovery from Noel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Argh. (Very red face!)</p>
<p>I worked out the trap stack layout by looking at m40.s and trap.c, and totally forgot about the return PC
(that's the 0444) from the call to trap():</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>0001740 000013 141756 022050 000013 000000 000000 000000 000034

</pre></div>


<p>I clearly should have looked at core(V) in the V6 manual!</p>
<p>The R6 you have recorded is correct for just after the trap; that's the kernel mode SP, which points to the
top of the kernel stack, in segment 6 (in the swappable per-process kernel area, which runs from
140000-1776).</p>
<p>So there is no R5 mystery, I was just confused. Back to the other two!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But meanwhile, back in front of the actual machine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seeing some quite strange stuff now, after the crash, flipping between "CONS PHY" and "PROG PHY"...</p>
<p>Bits 6-12 are not acting as I would expect, almost as if the KT11 ALU is doing an incorrect operation
(subtraction rather than add!)  </p>
<p>I see these are 74S181 bit slice ALUs, and function code should be hardwired to "A+B"... So that brings us
back around to really checking those supply voltages...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out the +5V supplies were, in fact, slightly low (about 4.9 or so).  Trimmed these up, and the the
observed problems with bits 6-12 receded, though the "ls" crash remained exactly the same.  It would appear,
though, consistent with remarks above, that the machine has very little undervoltage tolerance on +5V --
certainly less than the documented -5%.</p>
<p>How long had the machine been in this condition, and what else might have been affected?  It could not have
been for very long, since the previously run KT11 diagnostics would certainly have failed.  But the situation
was spooky, and instilled some uncertainty about other data that had recently been retrieved via the front
panel...</p>
<h3>February 5</h3>
<p>Noel clears away one additional address calculation error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I had to grub a bit to find this, but here's what I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With KISA7 at 001641, 0164100 should be the first location after the stack, so 0164060 and up would be
good. They <em>should</em> be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">060</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">000000</span> <span class="mi">000020</span> <span class="mi">000001</span> <span class="mi">177770</span> <span class="mi">177774</span> <span class="mi">177777</span> <span class="mi">071554</span> <span class="mi">000000</span>
</pre></div>


</blockquote>
<p>and I have no idea how I screwed the address there up that that badly. The data I'm showing there is the top
(address-wise; i.e. bottom, push-pop-wise) of the user stack, and I think it's correct. However, it's UISA7
which contains 01641, and that's the 'bottom' of that segment. I had previously done the math correctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>base of user data is at 0176000 (per UISA1 contents), runs to 0201476 (i.e. plus 03500); the stack would
run from 0201500 to 0204076 (i.e. plus 02400). So the stack segment 'base' would be 020000 below the next
word, or 0164100.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So physical 0164060 is just in the middle of nowhere; it's somewhere in the middle of the text (which starts
at physical 0161400).</p>
<p>If you could try this again, and check the top of the <em>actual</em> user stack (which will be at physical
0204060-0204076), I'd really appreciate it. I do expect it to be correct: the process core dump has it
correct (as shown by the analysis of argc, argv, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I am able to get some consistent, correct, data after the power-supply tune-up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, latest numbers for you!</p>

<p>...which looks at least like feasible code, if not the code we are expecting?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last, a note on procedure for using the front panel to verify KT11 address mappings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way this works is you select the mapping set you want (in our case, USER I) with the top knob on the
console, then toggle in a <em>virtual</em> address, hit "LOAD ADRS", and then when you hit "EXAM" it maps your
provided address through the selected set.  Under these circumstances, I'll also see the "KERNEL" light go
out and the "USER" light light up on the front panel indicating the active mapping set.  You can then flip
to "PROG PHY" to see the mapped-to physical address.  This is not explained very clearly in the handbooks;
it took me a little experimentation to figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>Anyway, in our case, I toggle in "10210", and can read out "171610".</p>

<p>The first 4 words, yes, but not the rest. (Oh, and your disassembly is wrong; you used PA addresses, not
VA.)</p>
<p>But excitingly, that <em>could</em> explain the MM trap, since 16700/16152 at VA: 010210 gives us:</p>

<p>All together, this brings us to a significant juncture in the debug effort: the power supply issue has been
addressed, and various red herring have been cleared away.  Pre-conditions which exactly match the observed
fault are apparent.  We are left with a single, consistent, and reproducible issue: part of the process
address space ends up holding the wrong part of the program text.  But how, and why?</p></div>
