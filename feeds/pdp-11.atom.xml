Mostly going after some corrosion on the CPU cabinet and H742 power supplies.  Tore these down, sanded down the corroded bits, then hit with a satin finish Rustoleum rattle-can which dries to a reasonable approximation of the original poweder-coat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neon indicators on the H742s are dim and flickery, so ordered some replacements for these, too.&lt;/p&gt;

In very good shape for some 40 year old kit!  The neon indicator lamps have gone, so I sourced the modern equivalent and put them on order.  Everything else is tight and clean:&lt;/p&gt;

Pics at the bottom!]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, sometime back in the mid-late '80s, when I was an undergraduate at CMU, I hung out a bit with the computer club there.  The club was flagging a little at that time.  The campus was awash with PCs, Macs, and "Andrew" IBM RTs, and the older DEC and IBM timesharing systems with their clusters of attached terminals were on their way out.  The incoming membership of the club was predominatly software-oriented, with a commoditized view of hardware, and the older hardware hackers were either graduating, disenfranchised, or hanging out elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, one of the club members introduced me to the club's nearly forgotten hardware lab (basement of Baker Hall I think), which was stuffed with remnants of the earlier age, including two or three PDP-11 systems with names like "Banshee" and "Centaur".  I thought these were the coolest things ever -- CPUs you could see inside, and actually hack with a soldering iron and a wire wrap gun!  Real front panels with lights and toggles, and machine language programming as a physical activity.  For a kid fascinated with computers, it was fantastic.  You couldn't get closer to the metal; you could quite literally get your head inside these machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began spending off hours as a solitary occupant of the club lab, puttering with the 11s and getting to know them.  Eventually, some of the club leadership decided it was time to clean house and remove all the older equipment.  Most stuff was scheduled to be hauled away to the dump.  I was welcome to anything I wanted to haul away myself in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I bothered some friends with a car, disassembled one of the 11/45s there ("Banshee" I believe) which seemed like the nicest thing, and hauled it off to my off-campus house.  There it resided in the basement with many other oddments for some years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I ended up moving out to CA on somewhat short notice.  And after some time the 11/45 was disassembled and packed into moving boxes for the west coast as practically as possible, leaving its beautiful but bulky cabinets behind...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of years in CA, I happened on a decomissioned two-rack 11/40 system at Stanford, essentially free for the effort of hauling.  Just the thing for reconstructing the 11/45!  So I procurred this and added it to a growing west coast equipment stash.  And then real-life set in -- job changes, house moves, raising a kid...  Through it all I carried the parts of these machines, vowing to "get to it someday".  I would pick at it through the years, but never had the time to really get very far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, "someday" is here!  The kid is off to college and I've moved house once again, but this time I reserved some working space for the project and pulled all the parts so they are together and accessible.  So here we go...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a some pics from the first weekend: the two H960 racks that are the bones of the whole thing, some glamour shots of the processor backplane and the RK11-C disk controller, and my buddy Chris helping to remount the RK05 drives on their rails temporarily to keep them off the floor and out of harm's way:&lt;/p&gt;
