    <div><p>The main bit I'm missing from the 11/45 is the power distribution harness; somewhere over the years this was
misplaced, or maybe I accidentally gave it away along with some excess 11/40 parts.  In any case, I haven't had any
luck tracking one of these down (made extra difficult by the fact that my 11/45 is an early model which requires a
slightly different harness than more recent models), so I'll have to build one myself from scratch.</p>
<p>Luckily the required harness is pretty well documented in the engineering print sets.  The crimp pins are standard
Mate-n-Lok still in production.  Some of the connectors are out of production, but they haven't been too hard to
track down.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of the amassed wire of appropriate guages and colors, connectors, crimp pins, and the start of
the harness build on the bench:</p>

Sat 09 April 2016

    </div>

    <div><p>I've been keeping an eye on eBay and have collected a few more goodies: a DD11-D nine-slot expansion backplane, a fully
populated (128K x 18bit) MS11-L MOS memory board, and a couple of replacement BC08-R cables for connecting the console
to the CPU cards.  The MS11-L is a bit of a luxury; I am figuring it will be easier to deal with during bringup than
the core memory systems I have on hand.  It will also be nice to run with a full address space.</p>
<p>Below is an updated shot of the CPU chassis with the expansion backplane installed, populated with bus jumpers,
terminators, grant continuity cards, the MS11-L memory, a DL11 serial interface, and an MR11-DB boostrap ROM.  I've gone
ahead and slotted in the FPU in the first four slots, since the cleaned and refurbished CPU cabinet is probably the
safest place to store them now.  Console cables are also installed:</p>
<p><a href="http://fritzm.github.io/images/pdp11/boards-in-chassis-2.jpg"><img src='/images/pdp11/boards-in-chassis-2_thumbnail_tall.jpg'/></a></p>
<p>The MR11 ROM is an interesting bit, and probably worth a comment.  This is a 32-word diode-matrix ROM card.  The bits
are physically laid out on the card (see pictures below); where there is a diode, there is a logical 1 bit and where
there is the absence of a diode there is a logical 0 bit.  Typically the matrix would be loaded with a bootstrap program,
to save the operator from having to toggle it in from the console on each boot.</p>
<p>The program could be modified by physically adding or removing diodes in the matrix.  My card has had such a mod; there
is a handwritten note attached from some engineer describing this.  The mod customizes the bootstrap to always load
from an RK disk unit, to avoid having to toggle in the device address at boot.  I will probably revert this mod because
I like having things in fairly stock/usual condition.</p>

<p>For fun, here's the source listing of the stock bootstrap.  You can match the octal digits of the machine code against
the diodes in the ROM above (low word addresses at the top of the matrix, and least-significant-bits on the left).</p>

    </div>

    <div><p>Spend some time reviving a VT52 that I intend to use with the PDP-11.  This was a pretty nice eBay find.  There was some
oxidation and flakiness with the connectors to the chargen ROM daughter card (I remember this being typical
of VT52s even back in the day).  A little more difficult to track down were some flaky solder joints around the clock
chip.  But, everything else seems to be in pretty good shape and its working well now!  Here it is hooked up to a linux
VM on my macbook, compiling some LSST code to generate some output as a test drive:</p>
<p><a href="http://fritzm.github.io/images/pdp11/vt52.jpg"><img src='/images/pdp11/vt52_thumbnail_tall.jpg'/></a></p>
<p>Man, seeing that funky font again, with its non-descending-descenders, is really great!  Surprisingly, it doesn't seem
to be available in digital format anywhere, unlike the later VT100 fonts, etc.  Try as I might, I couldn't seem to find
the chargen ROM listing in any of the DEC documentation archives, either.</p>
<p>Well, I do have a Digilent FPGA eval card and some level conversion chips laying around, so as a holiday hack project
I put together a quick ROM scanner in Verlog, interfaced it to the VT52 chargen on a breadboard, and scanned out the
contents.  Here's a picture of the scanner in action, and the produced output:</p>
<p><a href="http://fritzm.github.io/images/pdp11/rom-scanner.jpg"><img src='/images/pdp11/rom-scanner_thumbnail_tall.jpg'/></a></p>
<p>The yellow-ish board on the right is the VT52 chargen.  The Verilog source for the scanner, the scanned data, and some
preliminary attempts to convert the data to a few modern font formats are available on my github over at
<a href="https://github.com/fritzm/vt52">https://github.com/fritzm/vt52</a>.  I need to learn some more about font formats to make some better font files; if I do
I will update that repo.  Any help from fontophiles gladly accepted!</p></div>

    <div><p>Mounted the CPU backplane, and slotted in the CPU and MMU logic cards.  The empty slots on the right are for the FPU -- I have those on hand but figure I'll wait to slot them until I've got the basic CPU up and running.</p>
<p>One kind of interesting thing: the logic boards were stored vertically for several decades, and on some of the cards with plastic ribbon-cable connectors the plastic seems to have flaked and shed and fallen down the boards.  The flakey substance then grew some impressive crystals between some of the solder traces.  Scrubbed these out with some anhydrous IPA.</p>
<p>A tip copied from a fellow restorer: Alconox detergent for removing grime from various plastic components.  Parts soaked overnight come out looking nearly new (here you can see the cleaned plastic card guides).</p>
<p>Also pictured here are the characteristic bloody knuckles that are obtained whenever wrestling with PDP backplanes, logic cards, and terminators in close confines.  That really takes you back...</p>

    <div><p>Back in the mid/late '80s, when I was hanging around CMU, a computer club member introduced me to the club's nearly forgotten hardware lab.  It was still stuffed with remnants of the earlier time-sharing age, including two or three full-cabinet PDP-11 systems with names like "Banshee" and "Centaur".  I thought these were the coolest -- CPUs you could see inside, and hack with a soldering iron and a wire wrap gun.  Real front panels with lights and toggles, and machine language programming as a physical activity.  For a kid fascinated with computers, it was great.  You couldn't get closer to the metal; you could quite literally get your head inside these machines.</p>
<p>I began spending off hours in the lab, puttering with the 11s and getting to know them.  Eventually, the club decided it was time to clean house and remove all of the older equipment.  Most stuff was scheduled to be hauled away to the dump, but I was welcome to anything I wanted to haul away myself in advance.  So I bothered some friends with a car, disassembled one of the 11/45s there ("Banshee" I believe) which seemed like the nicest thing, and hauled it off to my off-campus house.  There it resided in the basement with many other oddments for some years.</p>
<p>Eventually, I ended up moving out to CA, and after some time the 11/45 CPU was disassembled and packed into moving boxes for the west coast as practically as possible, leaving all the bulkier parts behind.</p>
<p>After a couple of years in CA, I happened on a decomissioned two-rack 11/40 system at Stanford, essentially free for the effort of hauling.  This had most of the missing cabinetry, power supplies, and peripherals needed to reconstruct the 11/45!  So I procurred this and added it to a growing west coast equipment stash.  And then real-life set in -- job changes, house moves, raising a kid...  Through all of that I held on to all the parts, vowing to "get to it someday".  I would pick through the stuff from time to time over the years, but never had the time to take the project very far.</p>
<p>Well, now "someday" is here!  The kid is off to college and I've moved house once again, but this time I reserved some working space for the project and pulled all the parts so they are together and accessible.  So here we go...</p>
<p>Here are a some pics from the first weekend: the two H960 racks that are the bones of the whole thing, some glamour shots of the processor backplane and the RK11-C disk controller, and my buddy Chris helping to remount the RK05 drives on their rails temporarily to keep them off the floor and out of harm's way:</p>
