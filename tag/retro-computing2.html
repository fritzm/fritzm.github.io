    <div><p>Not much technical in this post, except the big ticket news: after all the recent repairs and generating a
fresh RT-11 pack <strong>RT-11 BOOTS FROM DISK!</strong></p>
<p>It's been a very long road getting here, but the machine finally has a working, full-featured, operating
system, capable of supporting self-hosted program development.  Spent a few enjoyable hours editing,
assembling, linking, and debugging some small MACRO-11 hacks directly on the machine, using the native RT-11
tools. This is probably a 40 year high-water-mark of functionality for these particular bits of hardware.
Very satisfying!</p>
<p>Next up will be to clean and inspect the dozen or so RK05 packs that I have on hand, and retrieve and
archive whatever content I can.  That should let me clear off a few packs to create some space to
experiment with some additional operating systems, including 6th Edition Unix.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div><p>After a lot of recent progress with the RK11, suffered a setback: after trying once again to image
a fresh RT-11 pack, the machine began to behave erratically at boot.  Sometimes the boot monitor would run
fine, sometimes it would run for a while and then take a machine exception or vector off to bad address,
and sometimes the machine would fail to boot at all, immediately taking exceptions of various sorts. Getting
so close, but then lost a lot of ground; I guess that's sort of the way it is going to be with a machine
that is this old...</p>
<p>So, back to the top without a working boot monitor.  Microcode sequencing and seemed to be working fine --
exam/deposit/step working reliably from the front panel.  Checked execution of the first few instructions
of the boot ROM in detail, a branch and some single operand instructions, and they seemed to execute
correctly.</p>
<p>Assuming some sort of new failure in the CPU, I prepared to instrument the Unibus with the HP
logic analyzer; it seemed that way I could trigger on machine exceptions then look back over the captured
address traces for a pattern.  To make sense of those, I'd need a listing of the boot ROM in hand.  Noel
Chiappa has a dump for this and a partial disassembly on his site <a href="http://ana-3.lcs.mit.edu/~jnc/tech/pdp11/ROMs/M9301-YB.mac">here</a>,
but is it the same as mine?  Better check...</p>
<p>Started to run through Noel's listing and compare to the ROM contents on my machine via front panel exam.
Sure enough, there seemed to be some words different in a few places.  Maybe the CPU is fine, and the ROM
card is failing?  Swapped out the M9301 for a simpler M792 diode matrix boot ROM, and sure enough -- was
able to boot straight away off my RKDP pack, and from there reliably beat up the CPU with diagnostics.  So,
great news: just a failing M9301!</p>
<p>Alright, so now I want to capture a dump of the M9301 so I can systematically compare with Noel's listing
to see if there's a pattern in failed/flaky bits to help guide my repair.  For this I need a memory dump
utility that I can toggle in from the front panel.  Came up with this:</p>

<p>Executed this a few times and got slightly different results, then things settled into a pattern where the
lowest nybble of every word was consistently zeroed but everything else was fine.  Smoking gun pointing to
a single PROM on the M9301.  Pulled and reseated that chip, and did the same for the other three while I
was at it, and ... everything 100% after that.  Wow, really should have just tried that first...</p>
<p>Well, at least I'm up and running again!  The memory dump program might come in useful again at some other
time, and as a byproduct after I fixed my M9301 I got 100% agreement with Noel's listing.  So I think that
listing can be considered authoritative now; good enough to generate replacement PROMs should anybody
ever need to do so.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div><p>Okay, back from travel and picked up the thread on the RK11 interrupt problem this weekend. Put the KM11 in
the first slot on the RK11 which allows to monitor interrupt request. An interrupt can be very easily
generated from the front panel by writing bit 6 (Interrupt on Done Enable) on in the RKCS register at 777404.
Did this, and noticed that interrupt request logic on the RK11 went active, but never cleared.</p>
<p>Checked bus request and grant continuity all the way through to the CPU backplane and back and that looked
fine (the RK11 in its default configuration uses BR5).</p>
<p>Chased bus request with a logic probe all the way to the CPU backplane, and it was being asserted correctly.
Looking at BG5, however, I noticed it was always asserted, even if BR5 was inactive. Disconnected all
peripherals and terminated the Unibus directly on the CPU backplane, and this was still the case. So there
was problem with BG5 in the CPU itself.</p>
<p>Threw the CPU UBC card out on extenders, and took a look at BG5 logic with a logic probe.  The 8881 driver
for this signal (E42 on sheet UBCD of the engineering drawings) had failed -- pins 8 and 9 were high, but pin
10, BG5, was not being driven low. Pulled this chip, put in a socket and a replacement, and the BG was then
working properly.  That's three repairs total to this poor old UBC card so far!  Was able to then verify from
the front panel that the processor fielded interrupt 220 in response to
setting the IDE bit in RKCS. Progress!</p>
<p>Back to the MAINDEC ZRKK -- interrupt test now passes, and the diagnostic continues. BUT... error output now
on test octal 57, which is working out the "hardware pole" feature of the controller.  Thought this might
be due to the RK11 being configured for two RK05 drives, but I have restored/connected only the first.
Rejumpered the G740 flipchip for a single drive, but this didn't seem to help.  Hmmm, will need to read the
diagnostic source to see what it is trying to do...</p>

Thu 08 June 2017

    </div>
    
    <div><p>Replaced the failed 7401 in the RKDA to RKDB data path, and verified that the RKDB stuck bit 11 problem was
fixed.  Ran the system for another couple hours to rewrite a fresh RT-11 pack, then another problem developed:
read operations would successfully obtain the bus, but would never complete.</p>
<p>Some investigation with a KM11 on the RK11 controller showed that POLE was now incorrectly asserted
continuously (did they mean "poll"?). Tracked this down to a failed 7420 (E1 on the M141 at A26, sheet
RK11-C-12). Replaced, and reads were working again. I guess with a machine this age there is going to be a
lot of this sort of thing where marginal parts give up after a few hours of use.  Hopefully after some
prolonged operation things will settle down a little bit...</p>
<p>In any case, <em>still</em> unable to boot any of my RT-11 packs.  I Decided to step back and run MAINDEC diagnostic
ZRKK. This is the RK11 dynamic diagnostic that destructively modifies a pack, and I had not previously run it
-- I had just optimistically jumped to trying to boot existing packs after the drive restore and calibration.
The diagnostic ran successfully for a while, through various format and read and write tests over the whole
pack (encouraging!), then hung up consistently on test 35 (octal), which tests whether the RK11 interrupts
the processor correctly when IDE is set.</p>
<p>So it could be the case that my RT-11 boots hang up when they first start trying to make use of interrupts.
Verified that I can run MAINDEC ZKWA, which tests interrupts from the KW11-L line clock, so interrupt
fielding in the CPU looks good.</p>
<p>Re-ran MAINDEC ZRKK, and noted that the CPU is waiting in micro-state BRK.00 (154) on page FLOWS 12 of the
engineering drawings. This state has a wait for Unibus INTR to be asserted, so it looks like a problem with
interrupt signaling on the RK11 side.</p>
<p>I have a bit of travel coming up, so I probably won't get back to this for a week or two. But the next
sensible step I think will be to work with a logic analyzer on the backplane of the RK11, slot A6 where the
M7820 interrupt control flipchip goes, and see what is/isn't happening with the interrupt signaling on that
end. I suspect there will probably be a failed IC on the M7820.</p></div>

    </div>
    
    <div><p>Decided to use the disk utilities provided in PDP11GUI to write a fresh RT-11 pack.  PDP11GUI successfully
assembled and downloaded a driver, then took a little under 2 hours to download the pack image over the
console serial line and write the pack without indicating any errors.</p>
<p>The resulting pack fared no better at boot than any of my existing legacy packs, however.  I attempted
to verify the pack via PDP11GUI, and noticed that the controller was indicating checksum errors for every
sector on cylinders 64-127 and 192-202 (that is, whenever bit 11 of the RKDA was set).  Tried this on several
other packs, including the RKDP pack which had previously booted, and found that these errors were returned
for these cylinders on <em>all</em> packs, so definitely a controller or drive issue, and not specific to any
particular pack.</p>
<p>Verified that bit 11 of the RKDA could be read and written normally, and that when so addressed the RK05
drive would mechanically seek to the correct cylinders.  Programmed some format-mode reads (these just return
sector headers) manually via the front panel, and verified that the sector headers were being returned
correctly from disk for the affected cylinders.</p>
<p>Tried a few flipchip swaps to see if the affected bit would move: B18 and B19 (adder; sheet RK11-C-14; no
change), A21 and B21 (RKDB; sheet RK11-C-10; no change).</p>
<p>Programmed some all-mode reads (these return preamble, header, data, and postamble) manually via the front
panel.  These showed that during reads of affected cylinders, bit 11 was stuck always on.  When reading
unaffected cylinders, bit 11 turned on and off normally.  So it seemed bit 11 was "leaking" from RKDA to
RKDB.</p>
<p>Seeing this, tried a few more swaps: A15 and B15 (internal bus, sheet RK11-C-20, no change), A23 and B23
(RKDB data path; sheet RK11-C-21; bingo!).  Stuck bit went away on this last swap.  So it looks like a
failed 7401, E2 on the M149 in slot A23.  Pulled, socketed, and put some 7401 on order at Jameco where I
can pick them up tomorrow on my way in to work.  Getting closer!</p></div>

    <div><p>Took a little of time to sort through BC11 cables to find a good one for drive interfacing, but in the end I
found one that worked okay and got the seek tester code from the previous post working reliably.  At this
point I mounted one of the recently cleaned RK05 packs, but found that the M9301 bootstrap would hang the bus
on the first read operation.</p>
<p>A little scoping around on the RK11-C showed that it was asserting NPR to the processor, but never receiving
NPG.  A quick check of NPG continuity on the backplane showed a missing jumper on one slot of my DD11-D.
Wrapped this on, verified NPG continuity all the way out to the RK11, but still no joy.  Turns out the CPU
is not asserting NPG at all.</p>
<p>Threw the CPU UBC card out on extenders and had a go at chasing though the NPG logic with a logic probe.
Turns out to be a failed 8881 bus driver for NPG at the end of the line (E55 on KB11-A drawing UBCD). Pulled,
socketed, replaced.</p>
<p>After this, the CPU was asserting NPG, but the signaling still looked a little squirrelly.  Turns out that
there are jumpers (W1-W5) on the M9301 bootstrap terminator that need to be installed to provide grant
pull-ups when they are not otherwise provided internally by the processor (and the 11/45 is one such
case).  After installing the jumpers, NPG signaling looked solid.</p>
<p>Tried mounting a booting a few packs.  Packs marked as having RT-11 would run for a short while and then hang.
But an RKDP pack <em>successfully booted!</em>  Wow, that feels pretty good after about two years of working
seriously on this restoration.  :-)</p>
<p>Going to stop here on a high note, and pick up trying to get a good RT-11 boot next time.</p>

        <a href="https://fritzm.github.io/rk05-2.html"><h1>PDP-11/45: RK05 II - Head Load and Servo Calibration</h1></a>
Sun 09 April 2017

by <a class="url fn" href="https://fritzm.github.io/author/fritz-mueller.html">Fritz Mueller</a>
 


 
    </div>
    
    <div><p>Okay, disassembled and cleaned a few RK05 cartidges, following advice from the vcfed forum and cctalk
mailing list (cleanroom gloves and wipes, 99% anyhydrous isoprop).  Was surprised to find foam inside
the hub on the disks (see pic below) but folks on vcfed advise that it is high-density polyeurethane
and not subject to decay to the same extent as the other DEC foams, so I left it be.</p>
<p>Mounted one of the cleaned packs, and let it spin in the drive for a few hours with head load disabled
in order to get a good flush on the air filtration system, let the various bearings on the drive loosen up,
and make sure the replacement head retract batteries got a good charge.  Drive ran quiet and balanced.</p>
<p>After that, took a deep breath and let the heads load -- no crash!  Proceeded to work through the dynamic
off-line calibration procedure for the head positioning servo system.  This involves jumpering the control
electronics on the drive to strobe simulated cylinder addresses from the sector counter.  That provides
a convenient source of oscillating seeks that can be used to calibrate the servos.  Video here shows head
load, a four cylinder oscillating seek, and a scope trace of the resulting sine position output of the electro-optical carriage position sensor:</p>
<p><span class="videobox">
                    <iframe width="640" height="390"
                        src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/b6p2ri-uM9c?rel=0'
                        frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen
                        mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen>
                    </iframe>
                </span></p>
<p>Surprisingly, after about thirty years of non-operation, all of the servo calibration was within specified
error bars, so no adjustments were necessary!  At this point I decided to go for broke, cabled the drive
to the RK11-C controller and attempted a boot.  Some cncouraging front panel indicator activity, but soon
halted with a seek error flagged in RKER.  Not too surprising.</p>
<p>Okay, on to debugging the drive online with the controller, then. Worked up the following test code, inspired
by something in one of the RK05 SPI workbooks.  This reads two cylinder addresses from the high and low
bytes of the front panel switches, and instructs the controller to instruct the drive to seek alternately
between them:</p>

<p>At first this code was generating no seek activity on the drive.  Decided to try swapping out the BC11-A
drive cable, and that produced some limited success -- drive seeks, but some bits of the cylinder address
are still apparently not making it across the cable.</p>
<p>The BC11-A cables are problematic.  They seem flaky and fragile, and many of my spares seem bad.  Any given
cable may beep out fine on the bench, and yet fail consistently in use...  It looks like what's up next is a
voyage through my box of spares, swapping in cables looking for one that works reliably.  Failing that, I'll
need work on some sort of modern replacement, since original BC11-A in good shape are getting hard to find.
It will be sad if at the end of this journey I can't boot the machine for mere lack of a good cable between
the drives and controller!</p>

    </div>
    
    <div><p>Started going through the two RK05 drives.  Lots of work to remove and clean up all the decaying foam.
Replaced the emergency head retract NiCd battery packs on both units.  They were both slightly leaky, but
luckily neither had made a big mess.</p>
<p>Air filter elbows are intact on both units, and still slightly flexible, though they do have a white
powdery coating where the material is degenerating.  Cleaned up okay with some warm soapy water and a
toothbrush.  I'm sure these will continue to decompose/decay, however, and in the long term having loose
particulates develop inside the elbow seems a certain recipe for a head crash.  I may explore the possibility
of 3D printing some sort of modern replacement for these.</p>
<p>Heads on the first unit look to be in decent shape, but some oxide buildup.  In the second unit, the
carriage was not parked, so the heads were in contact with each other.  They don't look damaged from a
preliminary inspection, but this head pair has considerably more oxide.  Before and after cleaning shots of
the upper and lower heads on the first unit below.</p>
<p>Pulled the H743 power supplies and reformed the larger electrolytics.  After this, both power supplies
powered up fine, though the -15V regulator on the first unit was trimmed very hot (-23 or so).  Trimmed this
down, put the supply back in the first unit and powered up.  Under load, the -15V regulator drooped to -8,
and a pico fuse on the +15V supply blew immediately.</p>
<p>Swapped in the -15V regulator from the second supply, which was not trimmed hot, and replaced the blown
pico fuse.  Now under load the supply held without drooping, and the +15V pico did not reblow.  So looks
like a bad -15V regulator.  Put a few 723 regulator ICs on order in advance of debugging this.</p>
<p>After getting the power supply in the first unit up and going, blower powers on, power indicator lights, and
after about three seconds the door safety relay clunks and load indicator lights. Write protect indicator
toggles with panel switch presses per expectation.  If the cartridge-on switch is depressed manually and the
load toggle is hit, the spindle motor spins up and runs smoothly.</p>
<p>There are some significant abrasions on the lower panel of the first unit under both the spindle and spindle
motor axles.  It looks like a spacer button which is intended to hold off the lower panel has decayed; will
need to improvise some sort of replacement.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div><p>Okay, the M9202 bus jumper arrived, and like the 2-foot BC11 cable, the occasional timeouts go away when this
is installed.  Hantek digital scope also arrived, so I decided to throw it on the backplane for a closer 
look at the SSYN and timeout signals.  The results were pretty interesting.  Here's a capture of an RKCS
access triggering a timeout glitch with the M902.  The yellow trace is BUS A SSYN L (taken from C12J1 on the 
11/45 backplane), and the blue trace is UBCB TIMEOUT (1) H (taken from D12U1):</p>
<p><img src='/images/pdp11/rkcs-timeout.jpg'/></p>
<p>What's interesting is that with the M9202 in place, the SSYN waveform shape on RCKS accesses is <strong>not</strong> 
significantly different -- and the timeout glitch still ocurrs from time to time, but at a reduced amplitude:</p>
<p><img src='/images/pdp11/rkcs-glitch.jpg'/></p>
<p>If the problem had been one solely of lumped loads on the bus, I would have expected the fix to manifest
as a waveform difference, and for the glitches to have disappeared.  These observations steered me back
toward my original (less plausible?) supposition -- the the 74123 one-shot in the Unibus timeout logic in the
CPU was flaky, and particularly sensitive for some reason to SSYN pulses of 568ns.  Adding some extra bus 
length via a BC11 or the M9202 moves the timing by a nano or two off the troublesome period, and reduces the 
magnitude of the glitches.</p>
<p>So I went ahead and clipped out the suspect 74123, and put in a socket and a fresh part.  Bingo!  Timeout
glitching was eliminated entirely.  Here's a trace after the 74123 was replaced.  This trace looks different 
because with the timeout glitch fixed, I could no longer use it to trigger the scope -- instead I had to
trigger on the trailing edge of SSYN, so we see both RKCS and non-RKCS bus cycles.  In any case, the timeout
glitching is now gone:</p>
<p><img src='/images/pdp11/rkcs-fixed.jpg'/></p>
<p>So that's a nice result -- I think the new scope is going to be pretty useful.  The rather extreme sawtooth
on the falling edge of SSYN on RKCS accesses still looks pretty bad to me, even though it is no longer
triggering timeouts.  I might try swapping out the M105 address decoder on the RK11, which generates this
signal, and see if the integrity here is improved.  All for now!</p></div>
