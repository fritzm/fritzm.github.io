<div><p>Tracked down the source of the inverted result after register-to-register move problem on GRA: outputs of the
subsidiary ALU control ROM E74 on pins 6 and 7 are floating.  Will need some closer inspection to determine if this
is a board fault or a chip fault.  In the meantime, I have a spare GRA which I had been reluctant to try because it
has a "bad" sticker on it...  Decided to give it a try anyway, and it seems to be working much better than the one I
have been debugging.</p>
<p>Now have enough of the CPU debugged to toggle in and run a simple light chaser program:</p>

Sat 18 June 2016

by <a class="url fn" href="http://fritzm.github.io/author/fritz-mueller.html">Fritz Mueller</a>
</div>
<div><p>After addressing the -15V problem on the MS11, most of the bad behaviors seem to have cleared up except a stuck (on)
bit 6 in the first 16K words of address space (000000-077776).  Hooked up the new logic analyzer, and it has been very
useful in troubleshooting the board -- can easily capture and inspect the timing of complete memory cycles.  Definitely
worth the investment!</p>
<p>Using the analyzer, I was able to verify the refresh and chip select logic on the board, then track down the stuck bit
to what seems to be a single failed DRAM chip (E96 on the MS11-L engineering drawings).  I'd like to test the entire
card before ordering replacement parts, but need to set up address translation to get beyond the first two banks from
the console.</p>
<p>Here is the address translation register setup that I used for testing.  This was followed by a deposit of 000001 to
KT11 SR0 (777572) to enable translation.  KT11 SR2 was left all zeros to keep D space disabled.  This setup allows
console access to physical addresses in banks 1 through 7 by appropriate settings of virtual address bits 13 through
15.  I wanted to reserve PAR7 to map I/O space, so I left out bank 0 since it was one of the two already tested.</p>

<p>This worked as expected according to panel PROG PHY and the logic analyzer, so the KT11 option which I had not
previously tested is at least working for kernel I space.  Tested each bank on the MS11 from the front panel using this
setup, and uncovered that bank 4 bit 10 also has a stuck on condition.  Since bank 1 is working now, I can use that
as work space for the time being in order to continue the CPU debug while awaiting some replacement DRAM chips in the
mail.</p>

chips:</p>

</div>
<div><p>Made some progress on the inverted result after register-to-register move problem: with the help of the KM11, extender
card, and a logic probe I was able to track down that signal ALUM L coming onto the DAP is not asserted when it should
be for a MOV instruction.  This means the ALU is performing in arithmetic instead of logic mode and thus the incorrect
result.</p>
<p>I next moved the extender card over to GRA, where this signal originates from a subsidiary ROM, but unfortunately at
that point the MS11-L memory behavior got even worse, putting and end to these experiments.  So I'll have to tackle
that first...</p>
<p>Moved the MR11 ROM over to the expansion backplane where the MS11-L resides, and it works fine there.  So it doesn't
seem to be a bus wiring or jumper problem onto the expansion backplane.  Checked the power input pins on the backplane
behind the MS11-L.  5V was a little low there; trimmed this up.  Probably need to clean or replace the Molex contacts
on the power distribution board in the cabinet, as it seems a few mV are being shed there needlessly compared to the
output of the same regulator on the main backplane, but things seem within stated tolerances for now.</p>
<p>The -15V input to the MS11-L was missing entirely.  Removed the DD11 expansion backplane, and added jumpers between
the battery backup supply inputs and the corresponding main supply inputs, per documentation.  Now have -15 to the
MS11-L, but still no joy.</p>
<p>Will need to go deeper into the MS11-L next time...</p></div>

</div>
<div><p>Received the boards and components for the KM11 replica; stuffed and soldered, and it appears to work!  There are
some photos below.  I can easily single-step microcode, clock states, and bus cycles now, which should really help
with the CPU debug.</p>
<p>Swapped DAP for a spare, and this has fixed the stuck PC issue.  Memory issues remain, but by choosing a working
memory range, I can start to toggle in and attempt to execute very simple programs.</p>
<p>The simplest possible program, unconditional branch to self, seems to execute correctly:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>001000 000777         BR      .-0

<p>A register to register data move test does not however:</p>

</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Control flow is as expected, but the value that ends up in R3 seems to be negated.  Still, pretty good progress!
Now that I can step machine states, the next step will be to put the DAP out on an extender card and start tracking
down signals with a logic probe.</p>
<p>The HP1662A logic analyzer from eBay has also arrived; should come in handy in investigating the memory issue.</p>

<div><p>Received and installed the replacement lamps for the -15V regulators.  Pic below shows what the power supply looks
like with all the lamps functioning.</p>
<p>Verified backplane DC voltages and ripple currents again, and re-trimmed all the DC regulators.  Verified AC LO and
DC LO de-asserted and free of glitches.  Found some harness wiring mistakes to the DD11 expansion backplane; corrected these.</p>
<p>Tried some CPU board-swaps looking for a quick win, but broken console behavior didn't change significantly with
different boards.</p>
<p>Investigated the timing generator board, and found that the crystal oscillator wasn't oscillating.  Tracked this down
to inductor L1 which looked as if it had been partially sheared away from the board at some point during installation/removal/storage.  Repaired this.  Success!  Able to load addresses from the front console now. Switches are mirrored
in the BR when halted in console.</p>
<p>Address bit 0 seems stuck.  Swapped PDR from spare board back to the original.  Can now examine and modify the
light/switch register, and examine the contents of the MR11 ROM.</p>
<p>Jumpered the DD11 expansion backplane back in, and slotted in the MS11-L memory.  Limited success: can modify and
examine memory for example near address 001000, but cannot modify low memory addresses.  In some ranges, can only
modify every other word.  Also, PC seems stuck at 022000.</p>
<p>At this point, I could really use a KM11 maintenance board set.  These are pretty hard to get a hold of, but a few
folks on the web have built their own reproductions.  I put in a PCB order to ExpressPCB with a KM11 layout by Tom
Uban (described <a href="http://www.ubanproductions.com/museum.html">here</a>), and also put parts on order to stuff it.</p>
<p>Also, figuring I'll need to be going deeper into the CPU debug, I found and bought an
<a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/142004889393">HP1662A logic analyzer</a> on eBay, for about the same money as the KM11 PCB and

<div><p>Connected up the aforementioned red wire hack to the new power harness, and verified +5V to slots 10 through 15.
Console is no longer all address and data lights on, but basic console load address / examine / deposit operations are
still not working.  A random assortment of address lines seem stuck, different on each power cycle.  About the only
thing that reliably functions from the console is loading the two highest address bits from the switches, immediately
after a reset.  Pulled the floating point unit, un-jumpered the DD11 expansion backplane, and removed all peripherals
except the MR11 diode ROM; same (broken) behavior...</p>
<p>Scoped all the DC voltages, and did not notice any glitches.  Pulled the H742s for some bench work: verified AC LO and
DC LO signaling on both units, replaced a broken Mate-n-Lok connector on one of the units, blew out dust from all the 5V
regulators and replaced their indicator bulbs with modern equivalent (CM7381). Sourced and put on order a modern
equivalent (OL-6003BP) for the indicator bulbs on the -15V regulators.</p>
<p>Next steps will be to verify various Unibus signals on the backplane, then maybe play some swap games with CPU card
spares to see if I can get closer to a working console as a starting point.  All I have time for this weekend, though; sorry nothing new to see so no new pictures this time!</p></div>

</div>
<div><p>Beeped out the new harness to check for shorts or incorrect pins, then plugged in just the H742s and fired it up.  All
the DC regulator modules seem to be working, and I was able to trim them up to nominal voltages at the CPU end of the
harness.  The indicator lamps on all but one of the DC regulators seem to be burned out, though, so I put some new lamps
on order (at last for the +5V regulators; a modern equivalent for the -15V regulators is tougher to find).</p>
<p>Given that success, I plugged in the CPU side of the harness, took a deep breath, and powered on!  Hmmm.  No detonations
or smoke, but all data/address/mode lights lit (see below), which is not right...  Front panel lamp test and data
address mode switches and indicators are working though at least.</p>
<p>Some investigation on the backplane turned up no +5V to slots 10 though 15, which could be part of the problem.  Ah,
that's what the mysterious clipped red wire soldered to the backplane might have been about (visible in the top right
<a href="http://fritzm.github.io/images/pdp11/kb11a-backplane.jpg">here</a>...)  Sure enough, some inspection shows the corresponding trace on
the backplane looks burnt!  I could hack this red wire into my new harness I guess, but I'd rather remove it and try to
repair the board trace with a shunt.  So the backplane will have to come out.  I guess that's what I get for not
investigating the weird red wire and for not beeping out the power distribution on the backplane before mounting
and populating it...</p>

<div><p>Moved the power modules and partial harness back over to the racks today, got everything remounted, finished and
dressed the backplane terminations, and completed the inter-H742 connections.</p>
<p>I did not do the runs for the backplane memory to the lower H742, as I do not have any backplane memory.  I probably
won't ever have any, either: these memory options are specialized to the 11/45, are quite rare, and only cover part of
the available address space.  Additionally, they would require me to track down the details of a backplane ECO to do
the corresponding parts of the harness correctly.  The core and MOS memory that I do actually have are all system-unit
options anyway.</p>
<p>Here are some pics of the in-rack wiring in progress, and a couple views of the finished harness.  If you add up
the capacity of the DC modules, you'll see that an 11/45 like mine (with floating point) is provisioned with +5V at 100
[sic] amps, and -15V at 20 amps.  That's no joke of a power supply...</p>

<div><p>The main bit I'm missing from the 11/45 is the power distribution harness; somewhere over the years this was
misplaced, or maybe I accidentally gave it away along with some excess 11/40 parts.  In any case, I haven't had any
luck tracking one of these down (made extra difficult by the fact that my 11/45 is an early model which requires a
slightly different harness than more recent models), so I'll have to build one myself from scratch.</p>
<p>Luckily the required harness is pretty well documented in the engineering print sets.  The crimp pins are standard
Mate-n-Lok still in production.  Some of the connectors are out of production, but they haven't been too hard to
track down.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of the amassed wire of appropriate guages and colors, connectors, crimp pins, and the start of

</div>
<div><p>I've been keeping an eye on eBay and have collected a few more goodies: a DD11-D nine-slot expansion backplane, a fully
populated (128K x 18bit) MS11-L MOS memory board, and a couple of replacement BC08-R cables for connecting the console
to the CPU cards.  The MS11-L is a bit of a luxury; I am figuring it will be easier to deal with during bringup than
the core memory systems I have on hand.  It will also be nice to run with a full address space.</p>
<p>Below is an updated shot of the CPU chassis with the expansion backplane installed, populated with bus jumpers,
terminators, grant continuity cards, the MS11-L memory, a DL11 serial interface, and an MR11-DB boostrap ROM.  I've gone
ahead and slotted in the FPU in the first four slots, since the cleaned and refurbished CPU cabinet is probably the
safest place to store them now.  Console cables are also installed:</p>

<p>The MR11 ROM is an interesting bit, and probably worth a comment.  This is a 32-word diode-matrix ROM card.  The bits
are physically laid out on the card (see pictures below); where there is a diode, there is a logical 1 bit and where
there is the absence of a diode there is a logical 0 bit.  Typically the matrix would be loaded with a bootstrap program,
to save the operator from having to toggle it in from the console on each boot.</p>
<p>The program could be modified by pysically adding or removing diodes in the matrix.  My card has had such a mod; there
is a handwritten note attached from some engineer describing this.  The mod customizes the bootstrap to always load
from an RK disk unit, to avoid having to toggle in the device address at boot.  I will probably revert this mod because
I like having things in fairly stock/usual condition.</p>

<p>For fun, here's the source listing of the stock bootstrap.  You can match the octal digits of the machine code against
the diodes in the ROM above (low word addresses at the top of the matrix, and least-significant-bits on the left).</p>
