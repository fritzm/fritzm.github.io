    </div>
    
    <div><p>Spent some time reviving a VT52 that I intend to use with the PDP-11.  This was a pretty nice eBay find. 
There was some oxidation and flakiness with the connectors to the chargen ROM daughter card (I remember this
being typical of VT52s even back in the day).  A little more difficult to track down were some flaky solder
joints around the clock chip.  But, everything else seems to be in pretty good shape and its working well now!
Here it is hooked up to a Linux VM on my macbook, compiling some LSST code to generate some output as a test
drive:</p>
<p><img src='/images/pdp11/vt52_thumbnail_tall.jpg' title='VT52 hooked up to a Linux VM for a test drive' onclick='pswipe("pdp11",17);'/></p>
<p>Man, seeing that funky font again, with its non-descending-descenders, is really great!  Surprisingly, it
doesn't seem to be available in digital format anywhere, unlike the later VT100 fonts, etc.  Try as I might, I
couldn't seem to find the chargen ROM listing in any of the DEC documentation archives, either.</p>
<p>Well, I do have a Digilent FPGA eval card and some level conversion chips laying around, so as a holiday hack
project I put together a quick ROM scanner in Verilog, interfaced it to the VT52 chargen on a breadboard, and
scanned out the contents.  Here's a picture of the scanner in action, and the produced output:</p>
<p><img src='/images/pdp11/rom-scanner_thumbnail_tall.jpg' title='Homemade FPGA ROM scanner used to read out the VT52 character generator ROM' onclick='pswipe("pdp11",18);'/></p>
<p>The yellowish board on the right is the VT52 chargen.  The Verilog source for the scanner, the scanned data,
and some preliminary attempts to convert the data to a few modern font formats are available on my github over
at <a href="https://github.com/fritzm/vt52">https://github.com/fritzm/vt52</a>.  I need to learn some more about font formats to make some better font
files; if I do I will update that repo.  Any help from fontophiles gladly accepted!</p></div>

the FPU -- I have those on hand but figure I'll wait to slot them until I've got the basic CPU up and running.</p>
<p>One kind of interesting thing: the logic boards were stored vertically for several decades, and on some of the
cards with plastic ribbon-cable connectors the plastic seems to have flaked and shed and fallen down the
boards.  The flaky substance then grew some impressive crystals between some of the solder traces.  Scrubbed
these out with some anhydrous IPA.</p>
<p>A tip copied from a fellow restorer: Alconox detergent for removing grime from various plastic components. 
Parts soaked overnight come out looking nearly new (here you can see the cleaned plastic card guides).</p>
<p>Also pictured here are the characteristic bloody knuckles that are obtained whenever wrestling with PDP
backplanes, logic cards, and terminators in close confines.  That really takes you back...</p>

<p>Spent some time on the front panel as well.  Removed the tubular lock and took a trip to the local locksmith
to have a new key made up.  Replaced all the incandescent indicator lamps with the closest modern equivalent.

<p>Neon indicators on the H742s are dim and flickery, so ordered some replacements for these, too.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div><p>Back in the mid/late '80s, when I was a student at CMU, a computer club member introduced me to the club's
nearly forgotten hardware lab.  It was still stuffed with remnants of the earlier time-sharing age, including
two or three full-cabinet PDP-11 systems with names like "Banshee" and "Centaur".  I thought these were the
coolest -- CPUs you could see inside, and hack with a soldering iron and a wire wrap gun.  Real front panels
with lights and toggles, and machine language programming as a physical activity.  For a kid fascinated with
computers, it was great.  You couldn't get closer to the metal; you could quite literally get your head inside
these machines.</p>
<p>I began spending off hours in the lab, puttering with the '11s and getting to know them.  Eventually, the club
decided it was time to clean house and remove all of the older equipment.  Most stuff was scheduled to be
hauled away to the dump, but I was welcome to anything I wanted to haul away myself in advance.  So I bothered
some friends with a car, disassembled one of the '11/45s there ("Banshee" I believe) which seemed like the
nicest thing, and hauled it off to my off-campus house.  There it resided in the basement with many other
oddments for some years.</p>
<p>Eventually, I ended up moving out to CA, and after some time the 11/45 CPU was disassembled and packed into
moving boxes for the west coast as practically as possible, leaving all the bulkier parts behind.</p>
<p>After a couple of years in CA, I happened on a decommissioned two-rack 11/40 system at Stanford, essentially
free for the effort of hauling.  This had most of the missing cabinetry, power supplies, and peripherals
needed to reconstruct the 11/45!  So I procured this and added it to a growing west coast equipment stash. 
And then real-life set in -- job changes, house moves, raising a kid...  Through all of that I held on to all
the parts, vowing to "get to it someday".  I would pick through the stuff from time to time over the years,
but never had the time to take the project very far.</p>
<p>Well, now "someday" is here!  The kid is off to college and I've moved house once again, but this time I
reserved some working space for the project and pulled all the parts so they are together and accessible.  So
here we go...</p>
<p>Here are some pics from the first weekend: the two H960 racks that are the bones of the whole thing, some
glamor shots of the processor backplane and the RK11-C disk controller, and my buddy Chris helping to remount
the RK05 drives on their rails temporarily to keep them off the floor and out of harm's way:</p>
